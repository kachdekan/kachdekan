ðŸ‘‹, my name is Kachi
====================

### I help companies automate their work using robots and smart machines. Sometimes I have to make the robots. In my spare time I noodle around with Web and App Development ([JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/)) and recently [Web3](https://ethereum.org/en/web3/).

Currently working as an Automation Engineer at **[Dekan Automation](https://da.co.ke)**. I am also making money and crypto simple and accessible for everyone at **[Clixpesa](https://clixpesa.com)**.
