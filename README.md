ðŸ‘‹, my name is Kachi
====================

### I help companies automate their work using robots and smart machines. Sometimes I have to make the robots. In my spare time I noodle around with Web Development.

Currently working as a Research Engineer at **[University West](https://www.hv.se)**. I also write about my work and share knowledge at **[ramboengr.com](https://www.ramboengr.com)**.
